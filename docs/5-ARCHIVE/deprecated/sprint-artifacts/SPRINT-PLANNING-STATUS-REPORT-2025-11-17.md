---

## Changes Made

### 1. Story Status Synchronization

**Before:**
- Epic 1: 6 stories marked "drafted" ✅
- Epic 2-9: 60 stories marked "backlog" ❌

**After:**
- Epic 1-9: 66 stories marked "drafted" ✅

**Reason:** All 66 story files exist in `docs/sprint-artifacts/sprint-*/` folders. The sprint-status.yaml file was out of sync with the actual file system state.

### 2. Story Key Corrections

**Epic 8:**
- Changed: `8-4-cross-module-insight-notifications-max-1-day`
- To: `8-4-cross-module-insight-notifications`
- Reason: Match actual file name `8-4-cross-module-insight-notifications.md`

**Epic 9:**
- Changed: `9-1-personal-settings-name-email-password-avatar`
- To: `9-1-personal-settings`
- Reason: Match actual file name `9-1-personal-settings.md`

- Changed: `9-3-unit-preferences-kg-lbs-cm-inches`
- To: `9-3-unit-preferences`
- Reason: Match actual file name `9-3-unit-preferences.md`

### 3. Timestamp Update

- Updated `last_updated` field to `2025-11-17` with comment: "All 66 stories synced to 'drafted' status"

## Story Format Analysis

All 66 stories are currently in **Sprint Planning Format**, which includes:

**✅ Present in all stories:**
- User Story statement (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance Criteria (detailed, testable)
- Functional Requirements Covered
- UX Notes & Design References
- Technical Implementation (detailed code examples)
- Dependencies (prerequisites, blocks)
- Testing Requirements (unit, widget, integration)
- Definition of Done (checklist)
- Related Stories
- Metadata (created date, author)

**❌ Missing from all stories (required for dev-ready format):**
- Dev Notes section with:
  - Architecture patterns and constraints
  - References with [Source: ...] citations
  - Project Structure Notes
  - Learnings from Previous Story
- Tasks section with:
  - Task breakdown mapped to Acceptance Criteria
  - Subtasks for implementation and testing
  - Task-AC mapping
- Dev Agent Record with:
  - Context Reference
  - Agent Model Used
  - Debug Log References
  - Completion Notes List
  - File List (NEW/MODIFIED)
- Change Log (versioning history)

**Conclusion:** Stories are ready for sprint planning and estimation, but NOT yet ready for dev agent execution. Each story needs to go through `*create-story` workflow to convert from sprint planning format to dev-ready format.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Sprint Planning Complete)

1. ✅ **Sprint Status Synchronized** - All 66 stories marked "drafted"
2. ✅ **Story Keys Corrected** - Epic 8 and 9 keys updated to match file names
3. ✅ **Report Generated** - Complete status documented

### Before Development Starts

**For each story that will be implemented:**

1. **Run `*create-story` workflow** (SM agent)
   - Loads sprint planning story
   - Loads tech spec, architecture, PRD, epics
   - Generates Dev Notes with citations
   - Creates task breakdown mapped to ACs
   - Initializes Dev Agent Record
   - Creates Change Log
   - Updates status: "drafted" → remains "drafted" (dev-ready version)

2. **Optionally run `*validate-create-story`** (SM agent)
   - Validates story quality
   - Checks source document coverage
   - Verifies task-AC mapping
   - Ensures previous story continuity

3. **Optionally run `*create-story-context`** (SM agent)
   - Generates dynamic story context XML
   - Assembles relevant docs and code
   - Marks story as "ready-for-dev"

4. **Assign to Dev Agent**
   - Dev agent implements story
   - Updates status: "ready-for-dev" → "in-progress"
   - Completes implementation
   - Updates Dev Agent Record
   - Updates status: "in-progress" → "review"

5. **SM Review**
   - Run `*code-review` workflow
   - Dev addresses feedback
   - SM approves
   - Dev updates status: "review" → "done"

## Workflow Sequence Recommendation

### Sequential Implementation (Recommended for Learning Transfer)

**Epic 1 (Foundation) - Priority:**
```
1-1 → 1-2 → 1-3 → 1-4 → 1-5 → 1-6
```

After Epic 1 completion, parallel development of core modules:

**Parallel Tracks:**
- **Track A:** Epic 2 (Life Coach MVP)
- **Track B:** Epic 3 (Fitness Coach MVP)
- **Track C:** Epic 4 (Mind & Emotion MVP)

**Sequential Finalization:**
```
Epic 5 (Cross-Module Intelligence) → Epic 6 (Gamification) → Epic 7 (Onboarding) → Epic 8 (Notifications) → Epic 9 (Settings)
```

### Story Point Estimates (From Story Files)

| Epic | Total SP | Stories | Avg SP |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Epic 1 | 20 SP | 6 | 3.3 SP |
| Epic 2 | ~30 SP | 10 | ~3 SP |
| Epic 3 | ~35 SP | 10 | ~3.5 SP |
| Epic 4 | ~40 SP | 12 | ~3.3 SP |
| Epic 5 | ~15 SP | 5 | ~3 SP |
| Epic 6 | ~20 SP | 6 | ~3.3 SP |
| Epic 7 | ~25 SP | 7 | ~3.6 SP |
| Epic 8 | ~15 SP | 5 | ~3 SP |
| Epic 9 | ~15 SP | 5 | ~3 SP |
| **Total** | **~215 SP** | **66** | **~3.3 SP** |

**Estimated Timeline (Velocity = 20 SP/sprint):**
- ~11 sprints (2-week sprints = ~22 weeks / ~5.5 months)

## File System Audit Summary

### Files Scanned
```bash
find /home/user/GymApp/docs/sprint-artifacts/sprint-* -name "*.md" -type f ! -name "SPRINT-SUMMARY.md" ! -name "VALIDATION-REPORT*"
```

**Results:**
- ✅ 66 story files found
- ✅ All stories have corresponding files
- ✅ No orphaned files detected
- ✅ No missing stories detected

### File Naming Convention
```
{epic}-{story}-{title-kebab-case}.md
```

**Examples:**
- `1-1-user-account-creation.md`
- `2-1-morning-check-in-flow.md`
- `4-12-cross-module-share-mood-stress-with-life-coach-fitness.md`

---

## Validation Status

### Sprint Status File Validation

**File:** `docs/sprint-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`

**Checks:**
- ✅ All 9 epics present
- ✅ All 66 stories present
- ✅ All 9 retrospectives present
- ✅ Status values are legal (drafted, backlog, contexted, optional)
- ✅ File is valid YAML syntax
- ✅ Story keys match file names (after corrections)
- ✅ Epic statuses accurate (all contexted via tech-spec files)

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Begin Implementation with Epic 1

**Reason:** Foundation epic, no dependencies

**Suggested First Story:**
```
Story 1-1: User Account Creation (3 SP)
```

**Workflow:**
1. Load SM agent fresh session
2. Run `*create-story` (will auto-detect 1-1 as first backlog... wait, all are "drafted" now)
3. Manually convert 1-1 to dev-ready or implement from sprint planning format

**Note:** Since all stories are now "drafted", `*create-story` workflow won't auto-find them. You'll need to either:
- Manually specify which story to convert to dev-ready
- Or implement directly from sprint planning format
- Or temporarily set first story back to "backlog" to trigger auto-detection

### 2. Consider Story Context Generation

For complex stories (5 SP), consider running `*create-story-context` to generate comprehensive technical context XML before implementation.

### 3. Track Learnings

As stories are completed, ensure Dev Agent Record is thoroughly filled out. This feeds into "Learnings from Previous Story" for subsequent stories in the same epic.

---

## Conclusion

**Sprint Planning Phase: COMPLETE ✅**

All 66 user stories across 9 epics have been drafted in sprint planning format and are tracked in `sprint-status.yaml`. The file system audit confirms 100% coverage with all story files present.

**Next Phase: Implementation Planning**

Stories are ready for conversion to dev-ready format via `*create-story` workflow, followed by dev agent implementation.

**Project Health: EXCELLENT**

- Comprehensive documentation
- Complete story coverage
- Well-structured epic breakdown
- Clear dependencies and sequencing
- Detailed technical specifications
