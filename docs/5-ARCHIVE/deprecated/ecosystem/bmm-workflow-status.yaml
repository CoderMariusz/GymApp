  LifeCoach AI - Ecosystem Workflow Tracker
  =========================================

  This file tracks the BMAD workflow for the ENTIRE ecosystem.
  Individual modules have their own detailed planning in:
  - docs/modules/module-fitness/ (GymApp - COMPLETE)
  - docs/modules/module-life-coach/ (PENDING)
  - docs/modules/module-mind/ (PENDING)

  The Fitness Coach AI module (formerly GymApp) has complete planning:
  - PRD with 23 FRs, 15 NFRs
  - Architecture validated
  - 3 sprints planned (43 SP)
  - Ready to implement when MVP starts

  This gives us a head start on the MVP!

  Next: Brainstorming Session to define:
  1. Life Coach AI module (core)
  2. Mind & Emotion module
  3. Ecosystem integration strategy
  4. AI infrastructure
  5. Shared platform requirements
