BATCH FILE ASSIGNMENTS - Conflict Prevention
=================================================================

RULE: Each file should be modified by ONLY ONE batch.
If overlap detected, higher priority batch takes precedence.

=================================================================
BATCH 1: Freezed Sealed Classes (Agent 1)
=================================================================

=================================================================
BATCH 3: Result<T> Pattern Fixes (Agent 3)
=================================================================
PRIORITY: MEDIUM
FILES TO MODIFY: ~20 files (pages/providers using .when())

lib/core/auth/presentation/pages/forgot_password_page.dart
lib/core/auth/presentation/pages/reset_password_page.dart
lib/core/profile/presentation/pages/profile_edit_page.dart
lib/core/router/router.dart
lib/features/life_coach/ai/providers/daily_plan_provider.dart (SHARED with Batch 2 - coordinate!)
lib/features/life_coach/chat/providers/chat_provider.dart (SHARED with Batch 2 - coordinate!)
lib/features/life_coach/presentation/providers/dashboard_provider.dart (SHARED with Batch 2 - coordinate!)
lib/features/life_coach/presentation/providers/goals_provider.dart (SHARED with Batch 2 - let Batch 2 handle!)
lib/features/life_coach/presentation/pages/goals_list_page.dart
lib/features/life_coach/presentation/pages/goal_suggestions_page.dart
lib/features/life_coach/presentation/pages/daily_plan_page.dart
lib/features/life_coach/presentation/pages/daily_plan_edit_page.dart
lib/features/fitness/presentation/pages/measurements_page.dart
lib/features/fitness/presentation/pages/templates_page.dart
lib/features/fitness/presentation/pages/workout_log_page.dart

NOTES:
- DO NOT modify files already touched by Batch 2
- Focus on .when() pattern fixes in UI layer
- Wait for Batch 1 to complete (Result<T> needs sealed keyword)

COMMAND AFTER: flutter analyze (no build_runner needed)

=================================================================
BATCH 4: Drift Value<T> Fixes (Agent 4)
=================================================================
PRIORITY: MEDIUM
FILES TO MODIFY: ~12 files

lib/features/fitness/data/models/body_measurement_model.dart (SHARED with Batch 1 - let Batch 1 handle sealed, this batch handles Value)
lib/features/life_coach/data/models/goal_model.dart (SHARED with Batch 1 - let Batch 1 handle sealed, this batch handles Value)
lib/features/life_coach/data/models/check_in_model.dart (SHARED with Batch 1 - same as above)
lib/features/fitness/data/models/exercise_set_model.dart (SHARED with Batch 1 - same as above)
lib/features/fitness/data/models/workout_log_model.dart (SHARED with Batch 1 - same as above)
lib/features/fitness/data/models/workout_template_model.dart (SHARED with Batch 1 - same as above)
lib/features/fitness/data/repositories/measurements_repository_impl.dart
lib/features/life_coach/data/repositories/goals_repository_impl.dart (SHARED with Batch 2 - coordinate!)
lib/features/life_coach/data/repositories/check_in_repository.dart (SHARED with Batch 2 - coordinate!)
lib/core/sync/sync_service.dart
lib/core/database/database.dart (only Value fixes, not @riverpod)

NOTES:
- Focus ONLY on .Value() → Value() replacements
- Do NOT modify @freezed or @riverpod annotations (other batches handle that)
- Can run in parallel with Batch 1 IF careful about merge conflicts

COMMAND AFTER: flutter analyze (no build_runner needed)

=================================================================
BATCH 5: Test Mocks Generation (Agent 5)
=================================================================
PRIORITY: LOW
FILES TO MODIFY: 7 test files ONLY

test/features/fitness/data/repositories/measurements_repository_impl_test.dart
test/features/fitness/domain/usecases/smart_prefill_service_test.dart
test/features/life_coach/ai/daily_plan_generator_test.dart
test/features/life_coach/data/repositories/goals_repository_impl_test.dart
test/features/fitness/presentation/pages/measurements_page_test.dart
test/features/fitness/presentation/pages/templates_page_test.dart
test/features/life_coach/goals/presentation/pages/goal_suggestions_page_test.dart

NOTES:
- ONLY modifies test/ directory
- NO conflicts with other batches
- Safe to run in parallel with all other batches

COMMAND AFTER: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

=================================================================
BATCH 6: Missing Files & Cleanup (Agent 6)
=================================================================
PRIORITY: LOW
FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY: Various

CREATE NEW FILES:
lib/features/exercise/presentation/pages/exercise_detail_screen.dart (NEW)
lib/features/exercise/presentation/pages/create_custom_exercise_screen.dart (NEW)

FIX IMPORTS IN:
All files importing 'package:lifeos/core/utils/result.dart' (should be core/error/result.dart)

FIX MISSING ARGUMENTS IN:
~20 files with missing_required_argument errors
(Find with: grep "missing_required_argument" analyze_output.txt)

FIX TYPE MISMATCHES IN:
~50 files with argument_type_not_assignable errors
(Find with: grep "argument_type_not_assignable" analyze_output.txt)

NOTES:
- This batch is a "catch-all" for issues not covered by others
- Should run LAST (after Batches 1-5)
- May have MANY file touches - coordinate with all other batches

COMMAND AFTER: flutter analyze

=================================================================
CONFLICT RESOLUTION STRATEGY
=================================================================

If two batches need to modify the same file:

1. Higher priority batch goes first
2. Lower priority batch waits or skips that file
3. Use git to track changes

Example conflict:
- Batch 1 (HIGH): Adds sealed to goal_model.dart
- Batch 4 (MED): Fixes Value() in goal_model.dart

Resolution:
- Batch 1 runs first, commits changes
- Batch 4 pulls Batch 1's changes, then applies Value() fixes

=================================================================
PARALLEL EXECUTION SAFE BATCHES
=================================================================

Can run together without conflicts:
✅ Batch 1 + Batch 5 (different file sets)
✅ Batch 5 + Any (test files only)
⚠️ Batch 2 + Batch 3 (some shared providers - coordinate!)
⚠️ Batch 1 + Batch 4 (shared model files - coordinate!)

Recommended parallel groups:
- Group A: Batch 1 + Batch 5 (safe)
- Group B: Batch 2 (alone, needs full provider context)
- Group C: Batch 3 + Batch 4 (coordinate on timing)
- Group D: Batch 6 (runs last)

=================================================================
VERIFICATION COMMANDS
=================================================================

After your batch completes:

# Check error count
flutter analyze 2>&1 | grep -c "error -"

# Check specific error types you were fixing
flutter analyze 2>&1 | grep "YOUR_ERROR_TYPE"

# Verify your changes compiled
flutter analyze lib/path/to/your/files/
